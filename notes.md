After the issues we were having last night, I propose splitting the modpack into two. The first has the minimum required mods that everyone has to have in order to play. The second being a set of optional client side additions I think are neat / great to play with. This would require deleting all mods and redownloading the

# Core Modpack: KronchPack

Base modpack with the minimum needed to join. I've reduced the number of cosmetic mods in an attempt to reduce lag. Reduced to 4 pages of suits instead of 5. Ideally this list of mods would not change very often.

## Core modpack mods:

### Core:

- **\*New\*** _MoreCompany_: Lobby expansion mod. Replacement for BiggerLobby that might cause less issues. More frequently updated than BiggerLobby. Comes with hats.
- _LateCompany_: Allows joining after the lobby starts.
- _MoreItems_: Allows more items on the ship between rounds.

### Gameplay:

- _Mimics_: fake fire exits
- _MaskedEnemyOverhaul_: removes the mask from masked enemies and increases their spawn and allows them to spawn on every map.
- _Skinwalkers_: Lets the AI use our voices
- _WeatherMultipliers_: Weather increases moon loot.
- _NicerTeleporters_: Teleporters don't strip your equipment (shovel, talkie, boombox)

### Cosmetic/fun:

- _YoutubeBoombox_: My beloved, play music off youtube.
- _BoomBoxOverhaul_: No energy use boombox, hear when not selected in hotbar, adjust volume with +/-. Three mods in one.
- _MoreEmotes_: OG emote wheel
- _TooManyEmotes_: New emote wheel
- _LethalFashion_: Unlocks base game suits
- _More_Suits_: Adds some suits, base for adding other suit mods
- _TooManySuits_: Adds suite rack pages
- _ViVKoCosmetics_: Adds some suits
- _WackyCosmetics_: Adds some hats for MoreCompany
- _Doms_Basic_Suit_Colors_: Adds basic suit colors

## Proposed new base/required mods:

These are some new mods I think could be fun. These range from really simple QoL additions to new maps and content packs.

### Minor tweaks:

- [_PushCompany_](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Midge/PushCompany/): Press "E" to push each other.
- [_JumpDelayPatch_](JumpDelayPatch): Reduces the jump delay.
- _[BuyableShotgunShells](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/MegaPiggy/BuyableShotgunShells/)_: Lets us buy shotgun shells in the store.
- _[MetalRecharging](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Bobbie/MetalRecharging/)_: Lets you stick a screw in the charger and go boom. Similar feature in _LethalThings_. Was technically in the modpack last night, how I died to lightning in the ship.

### Significant changes:

- [_SCPFoundationDungeon_](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Badham_Mods/SCPFoundationDungeon/): Adds a new possible dungeon to titan, I have no idea if it is any good but could be fun. Might be not so good for performance.
- [_LethalThings_](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/LethalThings/): "Adds 11 scrap, 6 store items, 1 enemy, 4 decor, 1 map hazard, and 1 game mechanic." Rocket launcher, darts, flare gun? I'm in.
- _[Kast](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Ceelery/Kast/)_: Adds a new late-game moon.
- _[Lategame_upgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/Lategame_Upgrades/)_: Adds lots of buyable gadgets and tools. Should probably not be used with LethalThings as there is some overlap in the types of tools methinks.
